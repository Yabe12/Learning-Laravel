The **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture is a design pattern used to separate concerns in software applications, particularly in web development. It organizes code into three interconnected components: **Model**, **View**, and **Controller**, each handling specific aspects of the application. Here's how it works in detail:

---

### 1. **Model**
- **Role**: The Model is responsible for the application's data and business logic. It interacts with the database and defines how data should be structured, manipulated, and validated.
- **Examples**: User data, business entities, or any data structure in your application.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Fetching data from a database or API.
  - Saving data to the database.
  - Applying business rules and validations.
  - Notifying the Controller or View when data changes.
  
  **Real-world Example**: In a business directory:
  - A `Business` model might include attributes like `name`, `category`, `location`, and methods like `getNearbyBusinesses()`.

### 2. **View**
- **Role**: The View is responsible for presenting data to the user in a visually appealing way. It focuses on the user interface (UI) and displays data from the Model.
- **Examples**: HTML pages, templates, or components that show information.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Displaying data passed to it by the Controller.
  - Providing a responsive interface for user interactions.
  - Remaining presentation-focused without including business logic.

  **Real-world Example**: 
  - A web page showing a list of businesses in a table or map view.

### 3. **Controller**
- **Role**: The Controller acts as the middleman between the Model and the View. It processes user input, interacts with the Model, and updates the View accordingly.
- **Examples**: Functions or methods handling user requests.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Receiving user input (e.g., form submissions, API requests).
  - Interacting with the Model to fetch or update data.
  - Determining which View to render and passing appropriate data to it.

  **Real-world Example**:
  - A function handling a request to view a business profile: 
    1. Fetch business data from the Model.
    2. Send the data to a View for rendering.

### Flow of MVC
1. **User Interaction**: The user interacts with the interface (e.g., clicking a button or submitting a form).
2. **Controller Handles Input**: The Controller receives the input, processes it, and calls methods on the Model.
3. **Model Updates Data**: The Model retrieves or updates data, applying business rules.
4. **View Displays Data**: The Controller passes data from the Model to the View, which updates the UI for the user.

### Example: Searching for a Business

#### User Interaction:
- The user types "Coffee Shops" into a search bar and clicks the "Search" button.

#### Controller:
- The Controller receives the search query and calls the `Business` Model's `search` method with the query.

#### Model:
- The `Business` Model interacts with the database to find businesses matching "Coffee Shops" and returns the results.

#### View:
- The View displays the list of matching businesses, possibly with links, images, and details.
